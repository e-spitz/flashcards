# FlashCards Game

## Abstract
FlashCards is a learning project built into a game! Using basic keyboard controls through the command line interface, the user can test their knowledge over array prototypes and objects! The game goes through thirty different cards. Each card will ask the user a question. The user is presented with three answers to choose from. Once the user chooses an answer, the game will return feedback on whether the answer chosen is correct! It will display the correct answer if the user answers incorrectly! After the user completes the deck, the game returns the percent of correct answers that the user answered and will also show the time it took to play. What a fun way to spice up some dense information!
